Text_Summeraization
Text summeraization had a major application in Document analyzing.
I used pre - trained model from Hugging face just to get started with these concepts.
It gives an Abstract Idea how the things are happening in chatgpt and other AI - Tools.
Here, Langchain transformers are been used for re-phrasing Summerized Text.
The link for pre-trained model LaMini LM Flan T5 248M : https://huggingface.co/MBZUAI/LaMini- 
The application is Simple Streamlit app , Which needs clear pdf as input and genrates Summerized content as a Single passage in English.
I trailed giving Tamil , English and Hindi.
Further improvement is to  Integrate with GoogleTrans API.
